# 📩 SMS Spam Detection

The repository contains a web application that detects whether an SMS message is spam or not, specifically tailored for the Indonesian language. Built using Streamlit, the application integrates a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to provide accurate classifications and confidence scores.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time Prediction: Classify single SMS messages instantly.
- Batch Processing: Upload CSV files to predict multiple messages at once.
- Interactive Visualizations:
  - Pie charts for confidence scores.
  - Bar charts for the distribution of Spam vs. Ham in uploaded files.
- Downloadable Reports: Export prediction results directly to CSV format.

## 🔁 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset "sms_spam_indo.csv" contains labeled SMS messages in Indonesian.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis to understand data distribution and characteristics.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled in `preprocessing.py` to clean and transform text data for modeling.
4. **Model Training** : Experiments with different algorithms in `main.ipynb`, leading to the selection of a LSTM model.
5. **Best Model Tuning**: Used keras-tuner for hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics using AUC are calculated to ensure model reliability.
7. **Model Deployment**: The trained model is integrated into the Streamlit app for user interaction.
